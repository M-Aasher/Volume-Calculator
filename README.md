## Purpose

To calculate the volume of three different 3D shapes using conditional statements, demonstrating logic control and formula application in C.

## Logic

• Input user choice (1 for Cube, 2 for Cylinder, 3 for Sphere).  
• Based on the selection:  

Cube: Volume = length³  

Cylinder: Volume = π × radius² × height  

Sphere: Volume = (4/3) × π × radius³  

• If the user enters an invalid choice, display an error message.  

## Example Input/Output
A. Enter the shape of which you want to find the volume   
   1.Cube   
   2.Cylinder   
   3.Sphere  
    1  
     Enter length: 5  
     The volume of cube is 125.00  

B. Enter the shape of which you want to find the volume   
   1.Cube   
   2.Cylinder   
   3.Sphere  
    2   
     Enter the length: 10  
     Enter the radius: 3   
     The volume of cylinder is 282.78  

C. Enter the shape of which you want to find the volume   
    1.Cube   
    2.Cylinder    
    3.Sphere  
     3   
      Enter the radius: 4  
      The volume of sphere is 267.81   

D. Enter the shape of which you want to find the volume    
    1.Cube   
    2.Cylinder     
    3.Sphere   
      5   
       INVALID CHOICE
